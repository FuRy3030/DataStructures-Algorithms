# Codex

This project features many data structures and algorithms. It aims to describe them by the same categories, including the principle of operation, time and space complexity, pros and cons, scenarios and examples of usage, and sometimes even code snippets.

Furthermore, Codex features a handy search bar that ensures fast and comfortable access to all of the sub-pages of the website - the user can instantly look for other elements. The application also includes helpful images in case of data structures and simple animations in case of algorithms.

Moreover, Codex provides a convenient way of comparing the data structures within the aforementioned metrics and criteria. It allows for making a comparison of three structures at the same time. As a result, the user can quickly decide which option fits his task the most.
